# Arginine Promotes The Activation of Human Lung Fibroblasts Independent of Its Metabolism
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40454944/

# Summary
We investigated the role and regulation of arginine metabolism in lung fibroblasts activated with TGF-β by analyzing TGF-β-induced gene expression in normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), comparing control male fibroblasts and male IPF fibroblasts cultured in HPLM using RNA-seq. We also analyzed the expression of arginine metabolic enzymes in fibroblast populations from single cell RNA-seq data from patients with pulmonary fibrosis and control donors published previously by Habermann et al (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba1972). 

# Geo Accession
The RNA-seq data generated for this study are available in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession GSE273882.
